# Configuration instructions

Incase you are migrating from an existing bird2 instance, feel free to either bind the `/etc/bird` directory directly to the container or just copy the contents into this directory ( `conf/` in the repository root)

Incase you are starting this from scratch, you might just want to create a new `bird.conf` file here. https://dn42.eu/howto/Bird2 has a good instruction of how to get started on writing a bird2 configuration file :)

# To-do list:

- [ ]  Add my include structure to include snippets of bird configuration as an example here.
